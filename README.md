# Compocyte


Compocyte automates cell type annotation for scRNAseq data. It uses a composite of hierarchically arranged classifiers to deliver accurate results while maintaining flexibility and modularity.

A pre-trained Compocyte classifier for annotating PBMCs in health and disease can be made available upon request.

## Getting started
